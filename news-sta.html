                  <h1 class="post-title">Making Waves! The STA agree exciting new partnership with The Everything App
                  </h1>
                  <div class="blog-post-info">
                    <p>With over 90 years of experience in aquatic education, the STA understands the powerful
                      connection between swimming and wellbeing better than most. As a UK-registered educational
                      charity, the STA has built its reputation on promoting water safety and swimming skills, guided by
                      their mission of teaching swimming and lifesaving to people of all ages and abilities. Now,
                      through its latest partnership with The Everything App, the STA is leveraging this expertise to
                      develop innovative programmes like "Couch to 1 Mile" - designed specifically for NHS staff and
                      their families but delivered through leisure operators and swim schools nationwide.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <h4>A partnership for purpose</h4>
                    <p>For the STA, supporting The Everything App aligns perfectly with their vision and values. The
                      charity recognises the immense contribution NHS staff make to society, often at the expense of
                      their own wellbeing. By partnering with The Everything App, the STA can leverage their extensive
                      network to create meaningful change.</p>

                    <p>The partnership goes beyond just offering services – the STA is actively signposting their
                      members and customers to support The Everything App, creating a ripple effect of support
                      throughout the aquatic community. This collaborative approach reflects the STA's understanding
                      that swimming isn’t just one of the most crucial life skills but can significantly impact the
                      health and wellbeing of individuals who enjoy swimming as part of a healthy lifestyle. </p>

                    <p>At the heart of this partnership is the development of new, tailored programmes such as "Couch to
                      1 Mile" - a progressive swimming programme that takes participants from basic water confidence
                      through to swimming a full mile. These programmes are specifically designed to be adopted and
                      delivered by leisure operators and swim schools but with clear entry pathways and promotional
                      pushes for the NHS staff and their families - recognising that many healthcare workers may be new
                      to swimming or returning to the water after extended periods away from regular exercise.</p>

                    <p>The programme's accessibility and progressive structure allows participants to build confidence
                      and fitness at their own pace - perfect for healthcare workers who may have limited time and
                      varying fitness levels. This approach aligns with the STA's commitment to inclusive aquatic
                      education while addressing the unique challenges faced by those working in high-stress healthcare
                      environments.</p>

                    <h4>A network of support for the NHS</h4>
                    <p class="mb-0">The STA's role extends far beyond programme development. With their network of over
                      20,000 swimming-teaching members and 300+ Approved Training Centres, STA is uniquely positioned to
                      mobilise the entire aquatic community in support of NHS staff. By encouraging their members to
                      support The Everything App, the STA is creating a unified approach to wellbeing support across the
                      UK's leisure and aquatic sectors.</p>

                      <div class="blockquote-content">
                        <p>The launch of The Everything App is a fantastic step forward in supporting the wellbeing of
                          NHS staff and their families. As an educational charity dedicated to promoting health, safety,
                          and enjoyment in aquatic activities, STA is committed to helping people of all ages and
                          abilities stay active and healthy, which is why we are proud to support this initiative. By
                          making physical activity more accessible and inclusive, the app will facilitate and open up
                          new opportunities for NHS staff to look after their own physical and mental health, just as
                          they take care of others every day. We look forward to working with all the sector partners to
                          see the positive impact this initiative will have.</p>

                      incredible expertise and reach to The Everything App and we are hugely excited about this
                      collaborative partnership. The development of new programmes such as the “'Couch to 1 Mile”
                      embodies exactly what we're trying to achieve - making wellbeing support accessible and practical
                      for NHS staff who give so much to others."</p>
